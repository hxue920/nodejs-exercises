### The Google Maps API key isn't working

The course might have hit a limit with the API key — if this is the case you need to sign up for your own API key over at <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage>. You will need to enable static maps for your API key. [Here is a quick video on how to do this](http://wes.io/khGn). 

Once you have the API key, simply place it in your `variables.env` file and restart.

### I'm getting errors related to `/data/db` like `code:100` and `connection failed`

## I'm getting a `URIError: URI malformed` error when running `npm start`

Thanks to [Chris Ellinger](https://twitter.com/devoidofgenius) for this: 

> If you’re getting a `URIError: URI malformed` error when running `npm start`, break out your environment variables. Go into `variables.env` and split the URI like this `MONGO_URI=mongodb://host.com:port` `DB_USER=username` and `DB_PASS=password`. Then inside your `start.js` replace `mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE)` with `mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {user: process.env.DB_USER, pass: process.env.DB_PASS});`. I had issues connecting to my mongodb because my password contained symbols.
